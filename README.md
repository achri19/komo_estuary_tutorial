Tutorial for building and running ANUGA hydrodynamic model

There are 6 tutorials:
Tutorial 0: Setup Colab
Summary: This notebook will walk through the process of installing packages, connecting to your Google Drive, signing up for Google Earth Engine, and using Google Colab (a free, online platform for running Python Jupyter Notebooks)

Tutorial 1: GEE Water Masks
Summary: This notebook will introduce Google Earth Engine (via Python) and produce water masks for the study area. This is a very time-intensive step so all output files will be provided

Tutorial 2: Build Digital Elevation Model
Summary: This notebook will walk through steps to build a DEM for the study area using open-source/publicly available datasets.

Tutorial 4: Mesh Generator	
Summary: This notebook will use the ANUGA mesh generator to build an uniform, unstructured mesh for the model domain

Tutorial 5: Run ANUGA
Summary: This notebook will run a short ANUGA simulation
Colab Notebook:
Tutorial 6: Post-Processing
Summary: This notebook will introduce ways to visualize the model output. We will also use QGIS to create animations.
